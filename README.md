# NBA Performance Analysis

## Motivation
This project aims to analyze the performance trends of NBA teams and players between 1997 and 2023 using statistical data. By examining various metrics such as points scored, rebounds, assists, and more, we seek to uncover insights into the evolution of gameplay strategies, player performance, and team dynamics over the years with especial focus in the playoffs.

## Libraries Used
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib: Data visualization.
- Seaborn: Statistical data visualization.
- Scikit-learn: Machine learning models for predictive analysis.

## Files in the Repository

- `nba_dataset/player_index.csv`: The main dataset containing an index of all NBA players with general information from 1997 to 2023.
- `nba_dataset/player_stats_traditional_po.csv`: Traditional player statistics during the playoffs from 1997 to 2023.
- `nba_stats.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data analysis, visualization, and interpretation.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project, its motivation, libraries used, files in the repository, summary of results, and acknowledgments.

## Summary of Results
After conducting the analysis, several trends and insights were observed:
- We can declare that the NBA is still vastly US oriented.
- The amount of players US-born is still dominating the league.
- Also, we can see and important increment of international superstars. It is not that the league is being populated by international players but those international players that arrive are in most cases becoming huge stars.

## Acknowledgments
We would like to express our gratitude to the person who added this dataset from NBA in KAGGLE so I can used for this work. Additionally, we thank the open-source community for developing and maintaining the libraries and tools that made this project possible.
