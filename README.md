# NBA Performance Analysis

## Motivation
This project aims to analyze the performance trends of NBA teams and players between 1997 and 2023 using statistical data. By examining various metrics such as points scored, rebounds, assists, and more, we seek to uncover insights into the evolution of gameplay strategies, player performance, and team dynamics over the years with especial focus in the playoffs.

## Libraries Used
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib: Data visualization.
- Seaborn: Statistical data visualization.
- Scikit-learn: Machine learning models for predictive analysis.

## Files in the Repository

- `data.csv`: The main dataset containing NBA performance statistics from 1997 to 2023.
- `analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data analysis, visualization, and interpretation.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project, its motivation, libraries used, files in the repository, summary of results, and acknowledgments.

## Summary of Results
After conducting the analysis, several trends and insights were observed:
- Identification of key performance metrics that have significantly influenced team success over the years.
- Analysis of player performance trends, including scoring averages, efficiency ratings, and positional evolution.
- Detection of patterns in team strategies, such as shifts in offensive and defensive tactics.
